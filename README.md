# Computer Vision Manual

Welcome to this open-source notes, the idea is to introduce yourselft to computer vision. This repository provides:
- 📘 **Conceptual overviews** of the most important vision tasks.
- 🧪 **Practical notebooks** to test real-world models.
- 📊 **Evaluation metrics** for each type of task.

## 🧠 What's computer vision?

Computer vision (CV)) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understanding visual information form the world.

It combines elements of image processing, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) to automate tasks that tipically requiere human vision.
